    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I am a Graduate Student at Penn State University, pursuing my master's in Data Analytics, and have completed my bachelor's in Information Technology in 2020. Working on Data, Analysis of Data, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are key parts of my learning curve and career goals. I have applied these skills to several of my projects and I am also currently getting good industry experience in using these skills with Cotiviti Inc. I enjoy solving business problems and gaining insights with data-driven solutions.</strong> I am a huge fan of Cricket and Soccer. I also like to spend my time reading self-improvement books as well as getting to know more about personal finance and money management techniques. Recently the stock market has also got my focus and I am keen on learning more about this.

    - title: "Video Object Removal"
      description: "The project's goal was a video inpainting task where we removed a target object from a video and recreated the background. Some objects, such as a chair or ball, can be removed directly, whereas, for other objects, images of the target object need to be provided. Using YOLO or Mask-CNN, objects were detected and removed, and then the background image was inpainted using deep learning. "

      description: "This project aims to reproduce a specific target singer’s voice, given input such as a musical score with lyrics. This was done in three steps. First, the input song was split into its vocal and music components. Then the vocals were converted into target audio using neuro-style transfer. After this, we merged both the target audio and the music to create the final output."
